# checkout_program
Simple python script that allows a user to input prices of items. 
The program will keep track of how many items were inserted, give the subtotal of each item addition, total, and average price. 

This script does not include measuers to identify errors such as the user typing a word instead of a number, but it can be easily done with "try/except"!
